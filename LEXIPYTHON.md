# Lexipython

This document explains the Lexipython suite. For the rules of Lexicon, see the [main readme](README.md).

To play Lexicon, all you really need is something for the scholars to write their articles on and a place to collect them. However, if people with doctorates are known for anything, it's their terrible handwriting and disorganization. Lexipython therefore provides tools to solve this most ancient of problems. To play Lexicon with Lexipython, appoint a player or a third party as the Editor. The Editor will need to download Lexipython, set up the game, and handle posting the pages somewhere all the players can access them.

## Functionality

To aid in playing Lexicon, Lexipython **does** provide the following:
* Specialized markdown parsing into formatted Lexicon entries.
* HTML page generation and interlinking.
* Handy help pages for rules, session information, statistics, and more.

Lexipython **does not** provide:
* Web hosting for the Lexicon pages. The Editor should have a plan for distributing new editions of the Lexicon.
* Checks for factual consistency between submitted articles. The Editor is responsible for ensuring scholarly rigor.

## Using Lexipython

<p>Lexipython provides support for a limited amount of Markdown-esque formatting.</p>
<pre style="background:#eeeeee">
# Author: Authorname
# Turn: 1
# Title: Example page

This is an example page.
Some words are //italicized//,
and some words are **bolded**.
All of these sentences are part of the same paragraph.

This is a new paragraph.\\
Unlike the last paragraph, this line will be after a line break within the paragraph.

This is an [[example citation|Phantom page]]. You can also cite a [[phantom page]] with just the title.

<p>Each turn, fill out the header with your author information, the  current turn, and the title of your entry. It doesn't really matter what the <i>Author</i> field is, except that it must be the same across all articles you write.</p>
<p>Two line breaks begins a new paragraph. A single line break does nothing, unless the line is neded by a double backslash (\\).</p>
<p>Text bounded by ** will be bolded: **bold** produces <b>bold</b>. Text bounded by // will be italicized: //italics// produces <i>italics</i>.</p>
<p>To cite another Lexicon entry, use double brackets. Text in double brackets will cite and link to the entry of the same name: [[Example page]] produces <a href="Example_page.html" class="phantom">Example page</a>. Text in double brackets split with a | will alias the link as the left text and link to the entry with the name of the right text: [[this text|Example page]] produces <a href="Example_page.html" class="phantom">this text</a>. <b>You must be precise in the entry title you cite to.</b> Citations to "Example" vs. "The Example" will point to different entries and create different phantoms, and your GM will probably have to clean up after you.</p>
<p>Beginning a paragraph with ~ will right-align it and place a horizontal line above it. Use this for signing your entry with your scholar's name.</p>

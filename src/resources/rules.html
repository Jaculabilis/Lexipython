<li>Each Lexicon has a <i>topic statement</i> that sets the tone for the game.
	It provides a starting point for shaping the developing world of the
	Lexicon. As it is a starting point, don't feel contrained to write only
	about the topics mentioned directly in it.</li>
<li>Articles are sorted under an <i>index</i>, a grouping of letters. An article is
	in an index if its first letter is in that group of letters. "The", "A",
	and "An" aren't counted in indexing.  <i>Example: One of the indices is JKL.
	An article titled 'The Jabberwock' would index under JKL, not T's index.</i></li><ol>
	<li>Until the game is over, some of the articles will have been cited, but not
		yet written. These are called <i>phantom</i> articles. A phantom article has a
		title, which is defined by the first citation to it, but no content.</li>
	<li>Generally, an index has a number of "slots" equal to the number of players.
		When an article is first written or cited, it takes up one slot in its
		corresponding index.</li></ol>
<li>Each turn, you will be assigned to write in an index.</li><ol>
	<li>Your articles should be written from the perspective of your character.
		Your character should be a scholar collaborating with the other
		scholars on the production of the Lexicon. You should play the same
		character for the duration of the game.</li>
	<li>If the index has open slots, you may come up with a new article title
		and write an article under that title. If all unwritten slots in your
		index are filled by phantom articles, you must choose one of them and
		write it.</li>
	<li>There are no hard and fast rules about style, but it is recommended
		that players imitate an encyclopedic style to stay true to the game's
		conceit.</li>
	<li>There are no hard and fast rules about length, but it is recommended
		that the Editor enforce a maximum word limit. In general, aiming for
		200-300 words is ideal.</li>
	<li>You must respect and not contradict the factual content of all written
		articles. You may introduce new facts that put things in a new light,
		provide alternative interpretations, or flesh out unexplained details
		in unexpected ways; but you must not <i>contradict</i> what has been
		previously established as fact. Use the "yes, and" rule from improv
		acting: accept what your fellow scholars have written and add to it in
		new ways, rather than trying to undo their work. This rule includes
		facts that have been established in written articles about the topics
		of phantom articles.</li></ol>
<li>Each article will cite other articles in the Lexicon.</li><ol>
	<li>You may not cite an entry that you have written. When you write an
		article, you may not cite it in later articles.</li>
	<li>As a corollary, you may not write phantom articles that you have cited.
		If you cite an article and then write it later, your former article
		now cites you, which is forbidden per the above.</li>
	<li>On the first turn, there are no written articles. Your first article
		must cite <i>exactly two</i> phantom articles.</li>
	<li>On subsequent turns, your article must cite <i>exactly two</i> phantoms,
		but you can cite phantoms that already exist. Your article must also
		cite <i>at least one</i> written article. You can cite more than one.</li>
	<li>On the penultimate turn, you must cite <i>exactly one</i> phantom
		article and <i>at least two</i> written articles.</li>
	<li>On the final turn, you must cite <i>at least three</i> written articles.</li></ol>
<li>As the game goes on, it may come to pass that a player must write an
	article in an index, but that index is full, and that player has already
	cited all the phantoms in it. When this happens, the player instead writes
	their article as **Ersatz Scrivener**, radical skeptic. Ersatz does not
	believe in the existence of whatever he is writing about, no matter how
	obvious it seems to others or how central it is in the developing history
	of the world. For Ersatz, all references, testimony, etc. with regard to
	its existence are tragic delusion at best or malicious lies at worst.
	Unlike the other scholars, Ersatz does not treat the research of his peers
	as fact, because he does not believe he has peers. Players writing articles
	as Ersatz are encouraged to lambast the amateur work of his misguided
	"collaborators".</li>
